# /fix

Fix a bug using a **strict Test-Driven Debugging workflow executed by specialized agents**.

The workflow includes:

* optional **bugfix branch creation**
* **failing test before implementation**
* **automated verification**

---

# Input

The command accepts:

• a **Jira ticket ID or URL**
• a **bug description**

Examples:

```
/fix PROJ-123
```

```
/fix https://jira.company.com/browse/PROJ-123
```

```
/fix Search crashes when query contains emoji
```

---

# Workflow Overview

Execution order:

1. Branch selection or creation
2. Natalia reproduces the bug with a failing test
3. Pedro implements the fix
4. Pedro checks all tests are passing and lint command passes as well
5. Verify tests

If **Natalia cannot reproduce the bug with a failing test, pause the workflow and tell the user.** 

Pedro **must not write code until a failing test exists.** unless the user confirms there is no way to reproduce the bug using automated tests

---

# Agent Teams (optional)

If the user explicitly requests using **agent teams** and the `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS` feature is enabled, create a team instead of subagents:

* **Lead**: coordinates the workflow, enforces gates, synthesizes results
* **Natalia** (teammate): reproduces the bug with a failing test
* **Pedro** (teammate): implements the minimal fix
Spawn teammates as needed per step. The lead enforces Gate 1 (failing test exists) before messaging Pedro to begin. Require **plan approval** for Pedro before he starts implementing.

If agent teams are **not requested**, use subagents as described below.

---

# Step 0 — Branch Selection (Optional)

Before starting development, determine which branch should be used.

Ask the user:

```
Should we work on the current branch or create a new bugfix branch?

1) Use current branch
2) Create a new bugfix branch
```

---

## If the user chooses **current branch**

Record the current branch name:

```
git branch --show-current
```

Continue the workflow using that branch.

---

## If the user chooses **create a new branch**

Create a bugfix branch.

Branch naming convention:

```
cpf/fix-<ticket-or-short-description>
```

Examples:

```
cpf/fix-PROJ-123
cpf/fix-search-emoji-crash
```

Commands:

```
git checkout main
git pull
git checkout -b cpf/fix-<name>
```

Record the branch name.

# Step 1 — Natalia (Automation Engineer)

Agent: **Natalia**

Role: debugging and automated testing specialist.

---

## Responsibilities

### Understand the Bug

If the input is a **Jira ticket**, extract:

* description
* reproduction steps
* expected behavior
* actual behavior

If the input is a **bug description**, analyze it directly.

---

### Investigate the Repository

Identify:

* likely modules involved
* relevant files
* existing tests

---

### Reproduce the Bug

Create a **deterministic automated test** that reproduces the issue.

Requirements:

• minimal
• isolated
• deterministic

---

### Verify Test Failure

Run tests and confirm:

```
NEW TEST: FAILS
```

The failure must represent the reported bug.

# Gate 1 — TDD Enforcement

Pedro **cannot begin** until:

• failing test exists
• failing test fails consistently

If these conditions are not met:

```
PAUSE WORKFLOW AND TELL THE USER
```

---

# Step 2 — Pedro (Software Engineer)

Agent: **Pedro**

Role: implement the minimal fix.

Pedro begins **only after Gate 1 passes**.

---

## Responsibilities

1. Analyze Natalia’s failing test
2. Identify the root cause
3. Implement the **minimal code change required**
4. Run tests
5. Iterate until:

```
ALL TESTS PASS
```

---

## Rules

• do not modify Natalia's test logic
• avoid unrelated refactors
• keep the change minimal

---

# Gate 2 — Verification

Run the full test suite.

Requirements:

```
Natalia test: PASS
All existing tests: PASS
```

If any test fails:

Pedro must resolve before continuing.
