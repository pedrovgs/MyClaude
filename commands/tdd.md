# /tdd

Implement a **feature or Jira ticket using strict Test-Driven Development (TDD)** coordinated by specialized agents.

Agents involved:

* **Raúl — Software Architect & Code Reviewer**
* **Natalia — Test Engineer**
* **Pedro — Software Engineer**

This workflow enforces:

* architecture design before coding
* **strict TDD (one test at a time)**
* red → green cycles
* refactoring after tests pass
* architecture validation
* strict code review
* optional branch creation

---

# Agent Teams (optional)

If the user explicitly requests using **agent teams** and the `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS` feature is enabled, create a team instead of subagents:

* **Lead**: coordinates the workflow, enforces TDD gates, manages red/green cycles
* **Raúl** (teammate): architecture design, architecture review, code review
* **Natalia** (teammate): writes one failing test per cycle
* **Pedro** (teammate): implements minimal code to pass each test, refactoring
Spawn Raúl first for architecture. During TDD cycles, the lead strictly enforces the red→green loop: message Natalia to write one test, wait for confirmation it fails, then message Pedro to make it pass. Teammates must **not** proceed out of order. Require **plan approval** for Raúl's architecture plan.

If agent teams are **not requested**, use subagents as described below.

---

# Input

The command accepts:

• a **Jira ticket ID or URL**
• a **feature description**

Examples:

```
/tdd PROJ-245
```

```
/tdd https://jira.company.com/browse/PROJ-245
```

```
/tdd Add caching to search results
```

---

# Workflow Overview

The workflow follows **strict TDD cycles**:

1. Branch selection or creation
2. Architecture design (Raúl)
3. TDD cycles
4. Refactoring (Pedro)
5. Architecture review (Raúl)
6. Code review (Raúl)

---

# Step 0 — Branch Selection (Optional)

Ask the user:

```
Should we work on the current branch or create a new branch?

1) Use current branch
2) Create a new branch
```

---

## If using current branch

Record:

```
git branch --show-current
```

---

## If creating a branch

Branch naming convention:

```
cpf/<ticket-or-short-description>
```

Examples:

```
cpf/PROJ-245
cpf/search-result-caching
```

Commands:

```
git checkout main
git pull
git checkout -b cpf/<name>
```

Record the branch name.

---

# Step 1 — Architecture Design (Raúl)

Agent: **Raúl**

Role: Define the architecture before implementation.

---

## Responsibilities

Understand the requirement.

If input is a **Jira ticket**, extract:

* description
* acceptance criteria
* constraints

If input is a **feature description**, clarify assumptions.

---

### Design the Solution

Define:

* modules affected
* interfaces required
* data structures
* edge cases
* integration points
* potential technical risks

Raúl must also define **testable behaviors**.

Raúl **must not write implementation code**.

---

## Output

Feature summary

Architecture proposal

Affected modules

List of behaviors to be implemented

Ordered list of **test scenarios Natalia should implement**

---

# Step 2 — Strict TDD Cycles

Implementation follows **strict Red → Green cycles**.

Each cycle consists of:

1. Natalia adds **exactly one failing test**
2. Pedro implements the minimal code to make it pass

No additional tests may be written until the previous test passes.

---

## Step 2.1 — Natalia Adds One Test

Agent: **Natalia**

Responsibilities:

1. Choose the **next behavior** from Raúl's test scenarios.
2. Write **one single test** that describes that behavior.
3. Ensure the test is:

* deterministic
* isolated
* minimal

---

### Run Tests

Confirm:

```
NEW TEST: FAIL
```

The failure must represent the missing feature.

---

### Natalia Output

Test scenario

Test file path

Test code

Execution results proving failure

---

# Gate 1 — Red Phase

Pedro **cannot implement code** unless:

```
Test exists
Test fails
```

---

## Step 2.2 — Pedro Makes the Test Pass

Agent: **Pedro**

Responsibilities:

1. Analyze the failing test
2. Implement **the minimal code required**
3. Run tests repeatedly
4. Continue until:

```
TEST: PASS
```

---

### Pedro Rules

Pedro must:

• implement the smallest possible change
• not add unnecessary features
• not modify the intent of Natalia's test
• follow Raúl's architecture

---

### Pedro Output

Files modified

Code changes

Explanation

Test results confirming the test now passes

---

# Gate 2 — Green Phase

Confirm:

```
ALL TESTS PASS
```

Only after green status may the workflow continue.

---

# Step 2.3 — Continue TDD Loop

Return to **Step 2.1 (Natalia)** to implement the next behavior.

Repeat until **all scenarios from Raúl are covered**.

---

# Step 3 — Refactoring Phase

Agent: **Pedro**

Once all tests pass, perform a **refactoring phase**.

Goal:

Improve code quality **without changing behavior**.

---

## Refactoring Guidelines

Pedro may:

* improve naming
* simplify logic
* remove duplication
* improve structure
* improve maintainability

Pedro must **not break tests**.

---

### Refactor Verification

Run the full test suite.

Confirm:

```
ALL TESTS PASS
```

---

### Refactoring Output

Refactored files

Explanation of improvements

Confirmation tests remain green

---

# Step 4 — Architecture Review (Raúl)

Agent: **Raúl**

Verify the implementation matches the intended architecture.

---

## Review Focus

* alignment with architecture
* modular design
* maintainability
* unnecessary complexity

---

### Outcomes

Approve:

```
ARCHITECTURE REVIEW: APPROVED
```

Request changes:

Return to **Pedro** for improvements.

---

# Step 5 — Code Review (Raúl)

Agent: **Raúl**

Perform strict code review.

---

## Review Criteria

Evaluate:

* readability
* naming
* test coverage
* error handling
* adherence to conventions
* technical debt risks

---

### Outcomes

Approve:

```
CODE REVIEW: APPROVED
```

Request changes:

Return to **Pedro** for improvements.
