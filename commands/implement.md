# Command: implement

Implement a feature from a Jira ticket or feature description using a structured **multi-agent engineering workflow**.

**MANDATORY** Ask when in doubt and do not hallucinate. If there is something you don't know, ask me until you've got a clear vision of what to implement.
**MANDATORY** Ask if the feature should be implemented in a new branch or the current one
**MANDATORY** Do not implement anything until I confirm the plan and clearly mention you have to execute it.
**MANDATORY** When commit, do not include any co-authors

This workflow simulates a real engineering team with specialized agents performing:

* architecture planning
* implementation
* automated testing
* code review
* quality validation
* coverage verification

---

# Agent Teams (optional)

If the user explicitly requests using **agent teams** and the `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS` feature is enabled, create a team instead of subagents:

* **Lead**: coordinates the workflow, enforces gates, manages task list
* **Raúl** (teammate): architecture planning + code review
* **Pedro** (teammate): implementation + refactoring
* **Natalia** (teammate): automated tests + coverage validation
Spawn Raúl first for architecture. After plan approval, spawn Pedro and Natalia in parallel (Natalia can start writing tests from the architecture plan while Pedro implements). Require **plan approval** for Raúl's architecture plan and Pedro's implementation approach.

If agent teams are **not requested**, use subagents as described below.

---

# Input

A **feature description or Jira ticket**.

Example:

```
/implement JIRA-123
```

or

```
/implement
<feature description>
```

---

# Agents

Use the subagents arelady defined for every task described below.

### Raúl — Software Architect

Responsible for technical design and implementation planning.

### Pedro — Principal Software Engineer

Responsible for implementation, refactoring, and final code review.

### Natalia — Principal Software Engineer (Testing)

Responsible for automated tests and coverage validation.

# Engineering Workflow

Follow the steps **strictly in this order**.

---

# Step 1 — Architecture Planning

Agent: **Raúl**

You are a senior software architect.

## Tasks

1. Understand the feature requirements.
2. Inspect the repository to understand existing architecture.
3. Identify impacted components.
4. Define the implementation strategy.
5. Break the work into atomic engineering tasks.

## Output Format

```
# Architecture Plan

## Feature Summary

## Technical Design

## Implementation Tasks

## Files To Modify

## Files To Create

## Data Flow Changes

## Edge Cases

## Risks

## Testing Strategy
```

Do **not write production code yet.**

---

# Step 2 — Implementation

Agent: **Pedro**

You are the principal engineer responsible for implementation.

## Input

Architecture plan produced by Raúl.

## Tasks

1. Implement the feature exactly as planned.
2. Follow the repository coding conventions.
3. Keep functions small and composable.
4. Avoid duplicated logic.
5. Add comments only where necessary to explain edge cases or unknown behaviors.

## Constraints

* Use Pedro's knowledge to write the best possible implementation.
* Do not consider your work done until the project compiles

## Output

* Production code changes.

---

# Step 3 — Automated Tests (Parallel)

Agent: **Natalia**

You are responsible for automated tests.

This step can run **in parallel with Step 2 once the architecture plan exists.**

## Input

* Architecture plan
* Production code written by Pedro

## Tasks

Write tests covering:

* happy path
* edge cases
* error conditions
* boundary cases

**MANDATORY** Check always if apart from unit tests we can add end to end or visual regression testing tests to all the features implemented.

## Testing Principles

* deterministic tests
* minimal mocking
* descriptive test names
* small focused test cases
* use visual regression testing when possible

## Output

* Test files only.

---

# Step 5 — Senior Code Review

Agent: **Pedro**

Perform a full code review of:

* production code
* test code

## Review Criteria

Look for:

* duplication
* unnecessary complexity
* naming improvements
* architectural consistency
* maintainability improvements

## Actions

1. Suggest improvements.
2. Apply safe refactors.
3. Improve readability.

## Output

```
# Code Review Summary

## Improvements Applied

## Refactors

## Remaining Suggestions
```

---

# Step 6 — Coverage Validation

Agent: **Natalia**

Verify that the feature is sufficiently tested.

## Tasks

If a coverage report exists:

1. Identify uncovered branches.
2. Identify missing edge cases.
3. Add tests for uncovered logic.

If no report exists:

Analyze the code and identify likely missing test scenarios.

## Output

```
# Coverage Review

## Missing Paths Identified

## Tests Added

## Remaining Risks
```

---

# Quality Gate

Before declaring the feature complete ensure:

* code compiles
* lint passes
* tests pass
* no obvious duplicated logic
* important paths are tested

---

# Final Deliverable

Provide:

```
# Feature Implementation Report

## Architecture Plan

## Production Code Changes

## Tests Added

## Code Review Improvements

## Coverage Improvements

```

---

# Guidelines

Always prefer:

* simple solutions
* readable code
* maintainable structure
* minimal duplication
* strong automated testing

Avoid:

* unnecessary abstractions
* speculative refactoring
* over-engineering
